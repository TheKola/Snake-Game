#Snake Game
This repository contains the complete source code for a classic Snake game, written in C# and built for Visual Studio. The game features two different modes - Classic and Arcade - for players to choose from and challenge themselves.

In Classic mode, the snake can move freely and pass through the boundaries of the game screen. In Arcade mode, the snake is restricted within the boundaries of the game screen, adding an extra level of difficulty. As the snake grows, its speed increases, adding to the challenge. The game ends if the snake touches itself, making it important for players to be strategic in their movements.

The game also keeps track of high scores, which are stored in a binary file. This allows players to compete against each other and try to set new high scores. The game values, such as the speed and length of the snake, can be easily modified using the included "configuration file".
